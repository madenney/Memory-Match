# Memory Match

## Overview

> This is a memory game where the user has to try to match pairs of face down cards. The twist in this one is that there
is an AI opponent with a perfect memory and the board gets bigger each round. Throughout the game, the user unlocks abilities
that will help them defeat the AI opponent.

#About

> This was a project I did by myself near the beginning of my web development training. It was a way to practice my basic
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery skills. I had a lot of fun making this one.

#Future

> If I was to come back to this and work on it again, there are several changes I would make. 
- Make the rules more clear and less boring to read.
- Make the owl better at trash talking
- Add sound effects
- Maybe some more interesting abilites
- Give each card object the jquery dom element it's connected to, instead of connecting through element id's
